INTRODUCTION
In a city roadâ€™s network, with n nodes, of which h are hospitals, and m edges, compute the distance
from each node to its nearest hospital. Our group decided to use an adjacency list to store the
nodes and edges and we will be using mainly the breadth first search algorithm to solve our
problems. 

Breadth first search algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph,
